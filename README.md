# Algorithms and Data Structure In JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and their
associated algorithms. The purpose of this repository is to learn more about data
structures and gain an expertise in general algorithmic paradigms such as:

1. Recursion
2. Greedy Algorithms
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Memoization
5. Amortized Analysis

At some point I would like to be an npm module that JavaScript developers could
use to build software with. I would also like to write some of these algorithms in
ES6.
