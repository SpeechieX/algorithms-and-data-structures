# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms. My goal here is to focus on algorithmic paradigms and data structures.

## Greedy Algorithms

A **greedy algorithm** makes a locally optimal choice in hope that, that choice will lead to a globally optimal solution.

## Dynamic Programming

## Divide-and-Conquer

The general idea behind a divide-and-conquer approach is: 

1. Break a problem into non-overlapping subproblems of the same type 
2. Solve the subproblems 
3. Combine the results

A **recurrence relation** is an equation recursively defining as sequence of values.
