# Algorithms and Data Structure In JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of various data structures
and algorithms. 



I plan to focus on implementing these algorithms using the main algorithm design paradigms:
divide-and-conqueur, greedy algorithm design and dynamic programming.

This README.md discusses time complexity and overviews general algorithmic ideas such as
the aforementioned algorithmic design paradigms, determining the asymptotic complexity of an
algorithm, amortized analysis and useful mathematics for algorithm design and analysis.
